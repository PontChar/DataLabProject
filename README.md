These files are 5 steps that I did for my final project in the Data Lab course. 
The first file is about downloading data that would be further used in the analysis. To download data I used JSON and API.
The second one is about setting up the database in which our files would be placed.
The third file is about filling the database with the files that we downloaded previously.
The fourth file was separated into three parts, each containing a full analysis of different data frames.
The last file is about preparing our data for visualization.
